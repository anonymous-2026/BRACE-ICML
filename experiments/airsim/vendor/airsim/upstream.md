# Upstream source (vendored)

This folder vendors the official **AirSim PythonClient** package `airsim` so this repository does **not** depend on local `UAV/ref/*` folders after open-sourcing.

## Source

- Upstream repo: `https://github.com/microsoft/AirSim`
- Upstream commit: `13448700ec2b36d6aad7a4e0909bc9daf9d3d931`
- Upstream path: `PythonClient/airsim`
- License: see `LICENSE` (MIT)

## Notes

- Vendored by copying the upstream `PythonClient/airsim` directory into `UAV/HATTO-UFog/AirSim/vendor/airsim`.
- Do not edit these files unless you also update this note and clearly document local patches.
