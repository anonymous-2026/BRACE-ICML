## OpenMARL (vendored; integrated)

This folder contains a vendored copy of the **OpenMARL** RoboFactory policy stack used by the BRACE RoboFactory VLA track.

- Not all code in this folder is original to BRACE; it is an integration of upstream code plus local glue/patches elsewhere in this repo.
- This folder intentionally does **not** include any checkpoints/weights/datasets.
