"""
lm-eval-harness integration for E-RECAP evaluation

This module provides custom task and model wrappers for evaluating
E-RECAP models using lm-eval-harness framework.

IMPORTANT: This is a setup/placeholder implementation.
- Does NOT execute real inference
- Does NOT load any actual model
- Does NOT require GPU
- Only defines structure, classes, and method signatures

TODO: In actual evaluation phases, implement real model loading and inference.
